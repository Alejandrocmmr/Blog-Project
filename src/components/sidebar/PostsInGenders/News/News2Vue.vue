      who were there and informed that the States States had been victims of a terrorist attack.

      The World Trade Center The two towers had been planned for commercial use in the early 60s,
      and the location chosen was next to the city's old port pier of New York, on the banks of the
      Hudson River, in the south of the island of Manhattan. Owned by Port Authority of New York and
      New Jersey, the project was carried out by architect Minoru Yamasaki, and the firm Emery Roth
      & Sons, and the structural part was under the responsibility of Leslie E. Robertson Associates
      office. The construction was delegated to Tishman Realty & Construction Company. The
      foundation stone was laid on August 5, 1966, and the construction would only be completed in
      April 1973. With 110 floors, and a height of 413 meters to the last altar, with the roof, rose
      to 417 meters, and the north tower, with the antenna of television at the top, reaching a
      height of 526.3 meters. Destroying the famous Empire State Building, in the period of 1972 and
      1973 was the tallest structure in the world, before the inauguration of the Sears Tower,
      located in Chicago. The total area of the buildings was 800,000 meters square, and had no less
      than 97 elevators for passengers and six exclusively for loads, in each. At the top of the
      south tower there was a snack bar, a souvenir shop, and Above is a viewpoint to observe New
      York City and New Jersey in 360 degrees. At In another tower, in which the television antenna
      was located, there was a sophisticated and expensive restaurant, Windows of the World, which
      was frequented by city executives. Since your opening on April 4, 1973, the World Trade Center
      became an icon of New York, a true postcard of the city. On February 13, 1975, a fire hit the
      11th floor of the north tower, in almost half of the area. Through the openings in the floor,
      used for passing the telephone wires, the fire ended up spreading to other floors, but they
      were efficiently extinguished. Some floors below also suffered damage, but were caused by the
      water used to fight the fire. Despite everything, the building was not damaged. structural.

      1993 attack On February 26, 1993, the explosion of a car bomb, which was parked in the
      basement garage of the north tower caused the death of six people and panic among thousands of
      people who were in the buildings. The cargo vehicle, leased to the transport company Ryder,
      was loaded with 682 kilograms of dynamite, the attack was carried out by terrorist Ramzi
      Yousef. The artifact caused the opening of a hole 30 meters deep. depth, the equivalent of
      four floors, and the destruction caused damage of 300 millions of dollars to the insurance
      company. Many people were trapped on the floors and were rescued by members of the Fire
      Department. 28 people managed to climb to the top of the building and were rescued by police
      helicopters. The management of the towers after of the attack placed emergency lights on the
      stairs of the buildings, which would help save many lives in the 2001 attack. The plan was for
      the explosion to bring down the tower north over the south tower, reaching New York's
      financial district, Wall Street. To the Investigations by the FBI and United States security
      forces led in 1997 and 1998 to arrest of the six Islamic terrorists involved in the attack.

      serving life in prison at the American base in Guantanamo, Cuba. A memorial in honor of the
      dead was built in the shape of a fountain in the square that was between the towers. When
      cleaning the rubble after the fall of the towers, parts of the fountain still intact were

      September 11, 2001 That morning of September 11, according to Nist's estimate "National
      Institute of Standards and Technology (the National Institute of Standards and Technology), if
      found 17,400 people in the two towers of the World Trade Center, but the owner of the
      buildings, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, counted 14,154 people. Daily an
      audience of more than 50 thousand people passed through the twin towers. Shortly after 8:30
      am, the American Airlines Flight No. 11, with 87 people on board, had departed from Boston
      Airport bound for Los Angeles, but shortly after takeoff a group of five terrorists kidnapped,
      threatening everyone with a bomb on board. Taking control of the aircraft, they diverted it
      from the route, heading towards New York, and at 8:46 am they threw the Boeing 767 against the
      facade north of the north tower, causing a violent impact between floors 93 and 99. The
      explosion resulting from the aircraft's 40 thousand liters of fuel caused major destruction.
      Seventeen minutes later, a second group, made up of five terrorists, similar, hijacked the
      United Airlines Boeing 767, which was on flight 175, also on the route Boston to Los Angeles,
      which carried 65 people, and has now hit the south tower of the World Trade Center, destroying
      the building between floors 77 and 85. The damage caused to the north tower by the flight 11,
      destroyed all means of evacuation for those above the impact zone, trapping, according to
      later information, 1,344 people. Flight 175 had a much less focused impact in relation to
      Flight 11, and a staircase was left intact; however, due to the flames, few people managed to
      successfully pass through it before the tower collapsed. Although the floors of south tower
      suffered minor damage, at least 700 people died instantly or were thrown by the plane's
      collision with the building. At 9:59 am, the south tower collapsed due to the violent fire,
      which damaged the structural steel elements, already weakened by the impact of the device. The
      north tower collapsed at 10:28 am, after being consumed by strong flames for approximately 102
      minutes. The vast majority of people who were below the impact zone managed to leave the
      buildings safely, along with 18 people who were in the impact zone in the south tower and used
      the building's intact staircase. But those who They were in the other building and didn't have
      the same luck. At least 1,366 people died as were on the impact floor of the north tower or
      higher floors, and at least 618 in the tower south, where evacuation had begun before the
      second impact. Thus, more than 90% of workers and visitors who died in the towers were on the
      impact floor or in the upper floors. Several buildings around the twin towers suffered from
      the attack. At 5:21 p.m., an outbuilding, 7WTC collapsed due to uncontrolled fires that caused
      failure structural. The Marriott hotel, known as 3WTC, was destroyed during the fall of two
      towers. The three remaining buildings of the WTC complex suffered severe damage due to the
      debris fell and ended up demolished. The Deutsche Bank Building, located on the other side of
      Liberty Street in relation to the World Trade Center complex, was later condemned due to toxic
      conditions inside the building that made it uninhabitable, and it was demolished. O Borough of
      Manhattan Community College's Fiterman Hall, at 30 West Broadway, was also condemned due to
      the damage caused in the attacks and its demolition was necessary. Another flight of American
      Airlines, number 77, a Boeing 757, with 59 occupants, which had departed from Dulles airport,
      in the capital Washington en route to Los Angeles, was hijacked by five terrorists, and
      diverted from the route, being thrown against the Pentagon building, headquarters of the
      United States military and defense intelligence, located in Arlington, Virginia. A Violent
      collision and the resulting explosion killed, in addition to those on board, 125 people who
      were in the building. The hijacker who piloted the plane had flying experience and was able to

      the floor, as the building only has five floors. United's Boeing 757, which performed the voo
      93, from Newark Airport, New Jersey, to San Francisco, California, was taken by four
      kidnappers. A group of passengers, after learning of the attack on New York, After talking to
      relatives on his cell phone, he decided to react to the kidnapping. In the action the The

      <span class="text-4xl">The victims <br /><br /></span>There were a total of 2,996 deaths,
      including the 19 kidnappers and the 2,977 victims. The fatal victims were distributed as
      follows form: 246 in the four planes (where there were no survivors), 2,606 in the World Trade
      Center and 125 at the Pentagon. All deaths occurred among civilians, except for 55 soldiers
      affected in the Pentagon building. 411 emergency team members who responded to emergency calls
      aid workers died when they tried to rescue people and put out the fires. The firefighters of
      New York City lost 341 men and two paramedics. New York police lost 23 members. The Port
      Authority Police Department lost 37 officers and eight EMTs and paramedics of private
      emergency services units were killed. Citizens of more than 90 countries lost their lives in
      the attacks on the World Trade Center, including from Brazil. In 2007, the office City of York
      medical examiner has released the official death toll from 9/11, adding the death of Felicia
      Dunn-Jones. Dunn-Jones died five months after the attack due to a lung disease that was linked
      to exposure to dust during the collapse of the World Trade Center. Heyward Leon, who died of
      lymphoma in 2008, was added to the official number of deaths in 2009. According to the
      commission's report, hundreds were killed instantly with the impact, while the others were
      trapped and died after the tower collapsed. For the At least 200 people jumped to their deaths
      from buildings (falling onto streets and rooftops) adjacent), hundreds of meters below. Some
      of the occupants of each tower, and who were above the point of impact, they climbed toward
      the ceiling, hoping for a rescue by helicopter, but the roof access doors were blocked. There
      was no plan helicopter rescue on September 11, unlike what happened in 1993; the smoke and the
      intense heat would have prevented such aircraft from carrying out rescues. Weeks after the
      attack, the number of lives lost was estimated at more than 6 thousand. It was only possible
      to identification of the remains of around 1,600 victims of the World Trade attack Center. The
      coroner's service also collected around 10,000 unidentified bones and fragments of tissues
      that cannot be combined for the list of identified dead. Fragments of bones were still being
      found in 2006 when workers were preparing to demolish the damaged Deutsche Bank Building. This
      operation was completed in 2007. On 2 April 2010 a team of experts in anthropology and
      archeology began searching for human remains, human artifacts and personal effects at the
      Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island, where some of the rubble from the towers was taken. The
      operation was completed in June 2010, with 72 human remains found, bringing the total number
      of human remains found for 1,845. The identities of 1,629 of the 2,753 victims have been
      identified. You DNA profiles, in an attempt to identify additional victims, are permanent. To

      the strange attitudes of a student, the Frenchman of Moroccan origin Zacarias Moussaoui, who
      just wanted to learn how to fly a plane without being interested in the moments of takeoff and
      landing, he had reported it to the police authorities. despite was arrested, his computer was
      not inspected. If the investigation had been carried out more competence, they would have

      The Federal Supreme Court (STF) is expected to resume, this Thursday (21), the trial of the
      landmark time for demarcation of indigenous lands. The score so far is 5-2 to invalidate the
      time frame thesis. The discussion on the topic will begin at 2 pm. Minister Luiz Fux must
      start the session with his vote. In addition to his, there are still votes from the ministers
      Gilmar Mendes, Cármen Lúcia and Rosa Weber.

      The time frame is a thesis defended by ruralists, establishing that the demarcation of a
      indigenous land can only occur if it is proven that the people were in the required space on
      October 5, 1988 when the current Constitution was promulgated. On Wednesday (20), the Minister
      Dias Toffoli concluded his vote against the validity of the thesis. After the opinion of the
      magistrate, the session was suspended. In his vote, Toffoli argued that “the intention
      constitutional is to ensure the right to indigenous lands based on the conceptions of the
      people themselves peoples over their land, so that occupation is in accordance with uses,
      customs and traditions”. In addition of Toffoli, ministers Edson Fachin, who is the case's
      rapporteur, Alexandre de Moraes, Cristiano Zanin and Luís Roberto Barroso were against the
      time frame. Ministers André Mendonça and Kassio Nunes Marques voted in favor of the thesis.

      It is expected that around 300 indigenous people will attend the session outside the Supreme
      Court, via a screen mounted under tents. Some indigenous groups tend to mobilize in caravans
      to Brasília on the days when the case is being discussed. This week, the Articulation of
      Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (Apib) organizes a camp at the Memorial dos Povos Indígenas, the
      about six kilometers from Praça dos Três Poderes, where the Court’s headquarters are located.
      The case in discussion in the STF is relevant, because, with the decision, what is decided
      will apply to everyone cases of demarcation of indigenous lands that are being discussed in
      court.

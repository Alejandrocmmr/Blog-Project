      Rio Grande do Sul and the southern and western portions of Santa Catarina are under yellow
      alert (danger potential) for storm, valid until this morning. Up to 50 mm/day of rain is
      forecast, winds of up to 60 km/h and hail. Inmet also warns that there is a risk of power cuts
      electricity, damage to crops, falling tree branches and flooding. The state was subject of
      heavy rains at the beginning of September, which caused flooding and left dozens of killed in
      the biggest natural disaster in the history of Rio Grande do Sul. Acre, Rondônia, much of
      Amazonas, the northwest of Mato Grosso and the southwest of Pará are also under yellow alert,
      but for intense rains. In the region, the forecast of rain and gusts of wind is the same as in
      Rio Grande do South, but without risk of hail. There is also a yellow gale warning in effect
      for seven states in the Northeast. Inmet predicts winds of up to 60 km/h in the interior of
      the region, in an area which covers parts of Bahia, Alagoas, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Rio Grande
      do Norte, Ceará and Piauí.

      Organs most affected by heat Which organs in the human body suffer most from heat waves?
      Cardiologist responds | CNN NEW DAYWhich organs in the human body suffer most from a wave of
      heat? Cardiologist responds | CNN NEW DAY In an interview with CNN this Wednesday (20),
      Stéphanie Rizk, cardiologist at Rede DOr and Sírio-Libanês, explained which organs are human
      body most harmed by the conditions imposed by the heat wave. See below:, Kidneys According to
      Rizk, the kidneys are the most affected organs, mainly due to dehydration. caused by the water
      consumed by the thermal regulation mechanism — which makes the body sweat to lower body
      temperature. “[The most affected is] the kidney, first of all. At first it reduces filtration,
      concentrates urine, and can increase the formation of kidney stones”, explained the
      cardiologist. Heart As the doctor pointed out, the heart can be affected because, in the
      process of regulating body temperature, vasodilation occurs, that is, increased blood flow.
      This increases the heart rate, which in turn can be dangerous if the person has any previous
      comorbidity. “The heart [is affected], mainly if someone has heart failure. With vasodilation,
      which occurs for us dissipate this heat, the heart accelerates and this can culminate in some
      decompensation of some illness,” she stated.

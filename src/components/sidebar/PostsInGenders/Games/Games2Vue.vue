      One of the first major updates that Diablo IV received, patch 1.1 is still remembered today
      for having nerfed several skills and made the game's endgame more laborious. The effects that
      he left were so lasting that they are still being corrected today by Blizzard, which released
      at the end of last week a hotfix aimed at making progression through the RPG a little more
      easy.

    <div class="p-2 px-14 mb-4">
      As Games Radar points out, the small update considerably increased the bonuses experience
      received when facing the highest difficulties of the title. Now the players will earn 5% more
      points in World Level 3, a value that increases to 15% in Level 4.

      This should help offset some of the cuts in experience points that characters from Diablo IV
      they gained by defeating monsters at a higher level. When patch 1.1 was released implemented,
      Blizzard decided to reduce the rewards obtained from killing from 25% to 15% creatures with 10
      levels (or more) above what the controlled character had.

      Although the hotfix improved the game's evolution process, its reception was not as warm when
      it could be. On Reddit, members of the Diablo IV community stated that preferred that Blizzard
      had never implemented the changes from patch 1.1 and, as a result, also did not need to
      correct its effects.

      “Classic blizzard. Reduce experience, then give experience back, call it a hotfix/patch”,
      stated the comment by SQRTLURFACE, which appears prominently among the answers from a
      publication made by the developer. This shows that, despite the attempts of the studio, he
      still hasn't managed to regain the good relationship he had with his audience.

      Blizzard says it will continue working to improve the action RPG, whether in the form of
      future expansions or by offering new seasons. The title will win in October This year's Season
      of Blood, which promises to bring a new narrative line and several mechanics inspired by the
      vampire universe.

      Developed by Capcom, Exoprimal unites two concepts that have already yielded many games,
      animes and interesting series: dinosaurs and futuristic exoskeletons. In it, players have the
      mission to, together with four other people, defeat waves of Jurassic creatures that literally
      rain from the sky from temporal portals, all to reach a destination before the opposing team.

      When this happens, there are usually two outcomes. Or the phase ends, rewarding as The team
      that managed to achieve the objective the fastest wins, or there is a small direct clash
      between the two competing sides. In the second case, the group that left behind can reverse
      its disadvantage, proving that he is better at PvP and completing the mission more
      competently.

    <div class="p-2 px-14 mb-4">
      For the opposing team, it remains to be devoured by dinosaurs and receive a smaller amount of
      experience points for your efforts. After that, just gather your learnings with the defeat or
      victory and repeat everything again in scenarios with objectives that vary little between
      themselves, which can be faced using a competent variety of armor.

      <span class="text-4xl">Exoprimal has a story to tell <br /><br /></span> Describing the game
      in a basic way, it seems like it doesn't have much to offer — an impression that your first
      Closed beta had already left. However, Capcom knew how to add components to the title that
      make him rise from mediocrity and encourage the player to continue playing — even other than
      indefinitely. For starters, Exoprimal has a story to tell — no a sensational story, mind you,
      but something entertaining enough to make you want to continue looking to see the next
      animated scene. In the distant future, humanity begins to suffer from strange phenomena that
      cause dinosaurs to literally “rain” on their major cities.

      As a way to combat them, several exosuits and the Leviathan artificial intelligence were
      created, which aims to promote a series of “War Games”. In them, the clothes technological
      technologies are tested in extreme conditions with the aim of seeking improvements that make
      them even better and result in the ultimate mechanical suit. However, tests soon give wrong
      and Leviathan starts to operate within a temporal bubble that surrounds the island of Bikitoa.
      The game starts from the moment the character controlled by the player and his team end up
      making a forced landing at the location and are forced to participate in the games while they
      try to find a way to escape the infinite cycle created by artificial intelligence.

      Involving elements such as time travel, corruption of large corporations and realities
      parallels, Exoprimal's plot is one that doesn't take itself too seriously and can get
      confusing at many times. However, it is engaging enough for the player to continue wondering
      what happens — think of it as a superhero movie, where the most The fights and special effects
      are more important than the central narrative. The plot is told through various files that the
      player collects after missions and are accessed through the “Analysis Map” menu, and by cut
      scenes that are unlocked after specific numbers of matches. The game always makes it clear how
      long it takes for an animation to be activated, which ends up serving as an incentive to play
      “just one more game” during the day. However, the Most of the plot takes place in the Analysis
      Map, which can be completely ignored by players. Just be aware that, after a certain point in
      the plot, deciding to can make some scenes and twists lose a little meaning. In general, the
      The way Capcom chose to tell its story is functional, even if it can't be considered
      completely ideal, as it allows key elements to be lost with certain ease.

      In a ceremony held this Wednesday (23) in Brasília, the federal government launched the
      National Identity Card. The ceremony was attended by President Jair Bolsonaro (PL). The main
      objective of the new document will be to unify the identity card in all Brazilian states and
      the Federal District. Check out the changes below:
    </div>

    <div class="p-2 px-14 mb-4">
      <span class="text-4xl">Unique registration number <br /><br /></span>The new document model
      adopted by the government will have the CPF as the unique registration number. Thus, the
      identification will be the same throughout the country. Currently, in case of need for a new
      issuance in another state, the citizen receives a new registration number. In the old model,
      it would be possible to have up to 27 ID numbers.
    </div>

    <div class="p-2 px-14 mb-4">
      <span class="text-4xl">Digitalization <br /><br /></span>The National Identity Card will have
      physical and virtual version, in addition to allowing checking by QR Code, even without the
      use of Internet.
    </div>

    <div class="p-2 px-14 mb-4">
      <span class="text-4xl">International document <br /><br /></span>Another novelty is that the
      national identity card will have an international standard, allowing travelers to use it
      outside the country. The document will have an MRZ (Machine Readable Zone) code, the same one
      issued in passports.
    </div>

    <div class="p-2 px-14 mb-4">
      <span class="text-4xl"> How will the issuance work? <br /><br /></span>The government has not
      yet explained how the new ID request process will work, but added that the issuance – both
      from the first version and after 10 years – it will be free.
    </div>

    <div class="p-2 px-14 mb-4">
      <span class="text-4xl">What is the reason for the changes? <br /><br /></span>According to the
      government, the new developments seek to modernize the country and reduce fraud, especially
      through unification of the identity number.

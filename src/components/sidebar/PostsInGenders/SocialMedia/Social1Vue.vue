      Recently, I noticed an intriguing trend on TikTok. The contents that started to appear for me
      they were no longer just one video, but the combination of two on the same screen. This is a
      technique known as "Dual Video", one at the top and the other at the bottom, to hold even more
      attention from the user. The aim is to provide visual and mental stimulation satisfactory,
      like knives cutting through foam, cans rolling down stairs or scenes from a game, while the
      user watches longer, verbalized content, such as the cut of a interview. When I mention
      "longer videos", I'm referring to videos that are longer than one minute. It's very strange to
      think that content lasting two or three minutes is too long, and I I agree, but it is the
      design of a reality driven by platforms in which users change stimuli dozens of times per
      minute
    </div>

    <div class="p-2 px-14 mb-4">
      The rule on a platform like TikTok is to change videos until you find something that catches
      your eye. attention. Its recommendation algorithm knows very well its more than 1 billion
      users around the world and delivers the videos that are most interesting to each one. This is
      it addictive experience that turned TikTok into a worldwide phenomenon in just a few years.
      Now the "Dual Vídeo" appears as a 'hack' by the creators, not just to circumvent possible
      violations of copyright, but mainly to engage users who are already under the influence of
      powerful algorithms. For you to understand the capacity of this type of system recommendation,
      I'm going to talk about a very relevant study
    </div>

    <div class="p-2 px-14 mb-4">
      Chinese researchers from Zhejiang University were keen to understand the impact of TikTok's
      algorithm in its users' brains. To do this, they placed volunteers in a functional magnetic
      resonance imaging machine to see what happened when they watched the content recommended for
      each of them by the platform's algorithm. The result of the study demonstrated that the
      recommendation algorithm is capable of discovering content that increases activity of a set of
      brain subregions that reinforce watching behavior more and more videos
    </div>

    <div class="p-2 px-14 mb-4">
      And this is not something restricted to TikTok. All platforms base their services on
      algorithms that recognize preferences and indicate content to fill the void in the user. And
      this has a series of cognitive, psychological, ethical and governance challenges. O ChatGPT
      stole the spotlight in discussions about AI this year, but we need to resume the debate about
      recommendation algorithms, after all, it is the type of AI that controls content traffic on
      the web and has the potential to modulate users’ perceptions and behavior.
    </div>

    <div class="p-2 px-14 mb-4">
      Some places in the world are more advanced in discussions on the subject, and Europe is one
      example. A new law has recently come into force in the European Union (DSA - Digital Service
      Act) that creates rules for platforms. One of the pillars is to ensure greater transparency of
      algorithms and autonomy for users, which led TikTok to propose changes to the operation of
      your service. To meet DSA requirements, the platform will allow European users turn off
      personalized recommendations. When the user chooses Therefore, the "For You" tab feed will
      show the most popular content according to the region in which you a person lives, but not
      based on his personal interests. This will be a feature optional for the user, who can disable
      the algorithm or not. Now it remains to be seen what they will do. I have a hypothesis that
      the vast majority will remain firm and strong dancing according to the song the algorithm
      plays. Recommender systems are designed to create a better experience and habituate our
      behavior, so it is difficult for a common user understand these implications and opt for a
      less rewarding experience.

      <div class="p-2 px-14 mb-4">
        Recently, Meta (owner of Facebook and Instagram) published, in the respected Science
        magazine, the result of a survey carried out with researchers who are partners of the
        company, which proves my point: people don't seem to like the chronological feed. When users
        used this version of social networks, instead of a feed fed by recommendation algorithms,
        activities and time spent on platforms dropped substantially. For a long time time,
        researchers and policymakers have argued that feed recommendation algorithms was the great
        villain who manipulated the behavior ofusers on the platforms. However, After the release of
        the Meta study, I noticed opinions suggesting that algorithms might are not the true
        antagonists, as they reflect what users want. Although, I think in reality it's exactly the
        opposite. The fact that people reduce activity in platform when the recommendation system
        leaves the scene demonstrates that the algorithm acts to conditioning users' behavior by
        delivering increasingly reinforcing stimuli. O Algorithmic God acts to restrict free will
        while simultaneously communicating a false feeling of freedom: "you can leave whenever you
        want". Now, we already know that it is not so It's that simple to fall into this fallacy.

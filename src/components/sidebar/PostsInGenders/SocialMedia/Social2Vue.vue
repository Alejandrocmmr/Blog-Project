      Intended to allow administrators to send content to an unlimited number of people, the
      function has the potential to change the way you interact with WhatsApp. Straight away, she
      already changed the way the application itself works, because: <br /><br />

      But don't worry, this isn't the time when an algorithm will decide which messages you see or
      don't see on the app. most used in Brazil. We have never seen private broadcasts anywhere else
      platform. We are launching an unprecedented product on the market Guilherme Horn, head of
      WhatsApp in Brazil Channels similar to those that WhatsApp launches are now present on
      Telegram for years. The Russian application does not, however, protect user information. users
      as proposed by the Meta service. It will work like this: Users will only enter on the Channels
      through a link; nothing that happens today in groups, in which administrators can include
      people without their will; The channel owner won't know who is inside (this includes cell
      phone number, name, photo, etc.); the members of a these spaces will also not have access to
      each other's data; not even friends will know about which channels any user participates in;
      All Channels will be muted from the factory; if If they want, members will have to change
      their settings to allow notifications.

      <span class="text-4xl">Limited interaction <br /><br /></span>Interaction levels up to they
      exist in the Channels, but they are limited. While the administrator can send texts, audios,
      videos and images, regular members will only be able to assign emojis to messages. Yet that
      way, they won't see how other members reacted. When content is forwarded for other WhatsApp
      environments, such as private conversations, will include links to sign up for channels from
      which they came. Unlike what happens in groups, users who If you enter a channel, you will see
      the content published there. But only the one posted in the 30 days previous ones.

      <span class="text-4xl">Two roads for messages <br /><br /></span>Another difference is that
      messages sent there will be encrypted, but not end-to-end, as occurs in other parts of
      WhatsApp. To do this, Meta engineers created two paths different within the application. One
      for end-to-end encrypted messages between sender and recipient. Another between the cell phone
      and the server for Channel messages. Newsletter A bulletin with the week's news and releases
      and a chat about new technologies. Every Friday. I want to receive It's a concrete wall, a
      wall that separates the two things. And it is technology that allows this. It's like imagining
      separate roads. These are areas completely independent Guilherme Horn The executive also
      explains that the decision was made so as not to prevent the new resource from having its
      growth limited. However, this does not mean that this is an irrevocable decision. For any
      product that Meta launches, and all Big Techs do it this way, there is a stage to test user
      behavior. In that We are currently launching encrypted channels. Doesn't mean it will always
      be this way William Horn

        >Content moderation Ã  la Facebook <br /><br />It is the absence of encryption end-to-end
        solution that will allow WhatsApp to moderate the content that circulates in these groups,
        exactly how it works on Facebook and Instagram. Without detailing how the filters work, the
        executive explains that this moderation combines an automated system powered by intelligence
        artificial with the work of human beings. "The amount of contentposted will not be different
        than we have on Facebook and Instagram, and moderation is not something new for Goal. We
        will restrict everything that is prohibited by law on the Channels", says Horn. In addition
        to illegal posts, WhatsApp applies rules established in special guidelines for the Channels,
        such as prohibiting the sharing of content that incites illicit activities and or
        fraudulent. Punishments range from warnings to administrators to suspension complete
